# Workflow for Carpentry@UiO Board Maintained GitHub Repositories [organisational](/organisational), [board](/board), [governance](/governance)

## Issues

- Carpentry@UiO has three repositories dedicated to organisation and coordination of the local community, the work of the Board, and the governance documents
- everyone can comment, ask questions, make suggestions, etc. to all repositories. Read [CONTRIBUTING](/contributing) to familiarize yourself with how to do that
- We use Issues for our workflow
  - Actions Points from meeting minutes and other organisational documents get turned into Issues
  - each new Issue is assigened to one or more Board members
  - each new Issue that is for the Board to handle is assigned the project "Board"
  - when updating/editing a document, create a Pull-Request and refer to the Issue in the commit message
  - when an Issue is completed, close it; it will be automatically moved into "Done" in the Kanban project management
  - when adding Action Points to meeting minutes and other documents, use the checkbox ```- [ ]``` for a new Action Point and the checked checkbox ```- [x]``` for completed Action Points
