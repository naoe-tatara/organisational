# Criteria for Applying for an Instructor Training Spot via UiO-Carpentry

## General

The University of Oslo Library is a Silver Member of the Carpentries. This includes 6 spots for an (online) instructor training per year. The Board of UiO-Carpentry has the task of recruiting and selecting instructor candidates by means of an open call for instructor candidates as well as targeted recruitment.

### Recruitment

- UiO-Carpentry wants to handle the allocation of spots as transparent as possible
- The Board, the library, or any active member of the community can suggest suitable candidates
- Candidates are asked to send a short application addressing a set of short questions to the Board
- The Board will review the applications based on the criteria listed below and decide which candidate gets allocated a spot
- The candidate who gets offered a spot must inform the Board no later than xx if they accept the spot
- It is the responsibility of the candidate to inform the Board if a spot is not taken due to any reasons after it has been accepted

## Challenges of previous recruitment

Challenges we have had the last couple of years: 

- 1) trainees not completing training (e.g., missed a training day 2) 
- 2) trainees not completing checkout 
- 3) trainees not motivated to teach
- 4) trainees not familiar with our community

The Board should know about and help address the challenges. This could be done by assigning a checkout-buddy, and might prove to be most helpful for 1) and 2). Actively managing aspiring instructorsâ€™ expectations might help with 3). 4) Could be helped by modifying recruitment, e.g. by recruiting personally and directly from the community, hosting regular onboarding sessions, meet-and-greet or other social events. More visibility of the instructor and helper community via the website might help, too.
