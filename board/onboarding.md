- Q1: what about those who did not consent? (prior to GDPR)

#### board @ swcarpentry
- is kept for current Board members only
- Q1: who should be owner(s)?
- O2: who is responsible for adding/removing subscribers?

#### carpadmin @ swcarpentry
- is to be used for admin-related communication
- should have few subscribers
- Carpentry@UiO local coordinators (atm NT and AR and MG)
- Q1: should anyone else be on this list? why?

#### contact-us @ swcarpentry
- has same subscribers as organizers @ swcarpentry (automatically signed up)
- atm to many people, creates spam, unclear who's responsible for answering
- proposal: actively add/remove subscribers to be only instructors who teach current workshops (i.e. per semester), to be maintained by local coordinators; remove automatic signup

#### organizers @ swcarpentry
- has all instructors, helpers, local coordinators, some library staff
- used for calls for instructors, invitations to social events, studygroup, other related events and activities
- too many subscribers are inactive (never teach/help, never respond)
- proposal: send out email to re-subscribe to this list by given date; remove those who haven't responded

#### research-bazaar @ swcarpentry
- was used for communication in regards to research bazaar
- UB has discontinued ResBaz
- proposal: delete mailing list
