## Meeting Minutes

### Mailing lists

- Old one will stop working soon. Make sure to use the right domain from now on.

- Unused emails have been removed. Some more will be removed soon. 
- People on the organizer list will get a "resubsribe" email, non-respndents will be removed. Users on the announcements list will not be changed.

### CarpentryCon @ Home
- There is now a local nordic carpentries list, local-nordic@lists.carpentries.org
- To subscribe go to [lists.carpentries.org] and look for the local nordic list

### Workshops Fall 2020
- Annika: Response for the UNIX shell workshops was very low (instructors and participants, helpers was ok).
- Is it the topic? Are the instructors to busy? Should we do online workshops instead? 
- Follow up by Annika
- R workshop 17 September might still happen. There seem to be enough participants and instructors / helpers

### Membership status
- Membership paid, with some delay
- Why did it take so long to get the membership renewed? Do we have to prove our worth more?
- Library is in the middle of restructuring, that's why it took so long.

### Instructor training
- Not enough candidates for the spots.
- Annika: We should make a call

### Taking Carpentries to the next level
- Get prioritized for the room booking, like regular courses.
- Can we get workshops to count towards compulsory teaching duty (plichtarbeid) for PhD students?
- Lex: start a dialogue, start with NatMat faculty
- Sabry has moved to another section, cannot be instructor as part of the working hours. Are there more people like this, who would like to teach but won't because they would need to use their paid holidays?
- reach out to USIT. USIT is going to be important part of the digital scholarship center (DSC), so they might be motivated to coorporate on this.
- Annika: has experience getting carpentries teaching as part of her work contract.
- Carpentries activities will fall under Digital Scholarship Center. DSC should be discussed in the meeting with the library. 
- Contact new library leadership. Lex will take the initiative, Annika will provide contacts

### NeiC Nordic infrastructure collaboration
- NeiC are a premium member of Carpentries. They are doing a centralised instructor training event. 
- 6 seats from UiO could be combined into central personal event together with NeiC
- having a 'nordic' instructor training could help to build the nordic community.

### Website
- There are too many websites for the carpentries
- move carpentries website under DSC website, make it look similar to website of academic writing cente. 
- Include: "Who we are" - active instructors, alumni, board (with pictures? --> make us more approachable 
- DSC is just a project now. Should carpentries site really be under it?
- Problem: Getting our own domain carpentry.uio.no requires going through a lot of bureaucracy

### What constitutes an official Carpentries workshop?
- Only official workshop should get the official label
- Currently, carpentry course and other "similar" courses get fed into the same feed and ae listed all together at uio.no/carpentry
- This is something to discuss when we have a new home

### Misc.
- Instructor training spots were hard to get, because North America was prioritized.
- Upcoming event: October 30th 1pm, community discussion by the carpentries. 
- Annika: Meeting with the instructor and helper base. Should be a bit longer than usual. Maybe we can do some social things, too.
