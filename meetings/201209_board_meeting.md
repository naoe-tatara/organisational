## Meeting Minutes

All board members present (Lex, Naoe, Annika, Viviane, Anne, Tobias)

### Review of [the annual report](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/reporting/report_carpentry-uio_2020.md)

- Good to see that it was almost like a "normal year"
- Discussion about the challenges of doing an online workshop 
    - Needed a little more time (but not much more)
- @Annika: Report will go to the leadership and there might be a blog post on the university library website.

### Plans for the spring

- @Annika will be on leave from 18th, Naoe will take over her tasks
- Not certain yet whether we can use the physical space
- Revive the study group? 
    - Contact Anne F.? 
    - Talk about it at the christmas mingle

### Seats on instructor training

- We got new instructors this year
- Some candidates didn't go through with it because of limited time
- Who else to ask? We have 4 or 6 (Naoe wasn't sure) seats left.
    - @Naoe got some requests for instructor training
    - @Viviane knows someone who might be interested
    - @Anne: There might be someone at USIT. But it might not be "allowed"
- Annika: We are still very STEM heavy, missing out on two of the biggest faculties. We should contact them and get instructors with a humanities / social sciences background.
    - @Annika has some people in mind, will share names
- AP: we will share information about who to nominate.

### Offering workshops for Humanities and Social Sciences

- More of the librarians will do teaching / research related activities - can we recruit some of them to be helpers / instructors?
- Research data managment are not very practical. Some of the practical aspects might be covered by DC courses
- offer lessons from [the programming historian](https://programminghistorian.org/)
- @Annika we might need to translate courses to Norwegian if we teach to an audience that is not researchers (e.g. at the national library).

### Post-workshop evaluation

- The feedback participation is relatively low.
    - Can we ask for the feedback in the last 5 minutes of the course - response rate would be higher 
- What kind of questions should we ask? 
    - The sticky notes are perhaps the most relevant for us (the carpentrie)
    - The library might want to know something else
- Can we have a local long-term feedback (a year or so after the workshop, "are you applying the things you learned now?")
    - We should use the Carpentries feedback mechanisms, so that the feedback reaches the global Carpentries community 
    - The carpentries sends out a long-term survey. 
        - Can we encourage people to participate by sending another email? 
        - Can we filter the responses to see only the UiO feedback?
- How can we do the sticky note feedback online
- Decision: close issue #33 and issue #70

### Carpentries@UiO website

- Library > course and events > freestanding courses > carpentry: training on foundational coding...
- lists 
    - upcoming workshops
    - what can I learn
    - link to the community page under DSC (digital scholarship center) page
        - DSC page might be relocated later, right now it's under "writing and publishing"
    - Who are we 

### Misc.

- Need to ask from instructors to put their name into a list on the website
- Still not clear who to talk to at the library
- Election will be moved to the spring
- Reminder: Christmas mingl on the 17th 3-5pm 
- Next board meeting somewhere in the spring
