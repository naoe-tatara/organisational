The aim was to create a forum for instructors, helpers, and other interested parties to meet and share expertise, information, and experience related to teaching workshops. Since then, the StudyGroup has served as a forum for knowledge exchange and social interaction with meetings ca. every other week.

  - Book Club (Teaching Tech Together, Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing)
- Documentation of all events and materials are publishied on the website of the [StudyGroup](https://uio-carpentry.github.io/studyGroup/)
- Activities are announced via the @swcarpentry mailing lists, the official website, a Google calendar, and the University Library's course catalogue, and Gitter

### Recruiting

- 2019 has been a record year in terms of recruitment and instructor trainees. In May 2019, an online Instructor Training event was held with 12 members of the Carpentry@UiO community participating. All participants were followed up by a local Instructor Trainer, their contacts were added to the organizers mailinglist for communications about upcoming workshops and community news
- 10 new helpers
- 12 new instructors (official training)
- 1 new instructor (not trained yet)

- It is planned to host the next CarpentryConnect event in Oslo in 2021; preparations will start in 2020
- UiO is host to the [Carpentries Regional Coordinator for the Nordic and Baltic Countries](https://carpentries.org/regions_nordic/) for the next two years
