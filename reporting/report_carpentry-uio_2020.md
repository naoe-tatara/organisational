## Learner Feedback and Continuous Evaluation

## Workshops

UiO-Carpentry arranged altogether 11 one-day Software Carpentry workshops (most of which could be taught on-site), and was part of two 2 two-day Data Carpentry workshops and 2 half-day mini workshops (taught online). During spring/summer and late fall Software Carpentry workshops were moved online, while several workshops in early fall could be arranged on-site with reduced participant numbers.

## Community Building & Social Events

COVID-19 posed a challenge in regards to community building and arranging social events for  UiO-Carpentry. With moving many activities online and good communication with our members, we managed to organise a fair number of social events and community activities.

### Onboarding

Three onboarding sessions were held, two on-site sessions in January 2020 and one online session in September 2020. Onboarding is intended for new instructors and helpers and as a general information exchange around the practicalities of running Carpentry workshops at UiO. Materials for the onboarding events are updated continuously and can be accessed on GitHub, [UiO-Carpentry/organisational/workshop_operations](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/tree/master/workshop_operations)

### StudyGroup

4 StudyGroup meetings were held between January and early March 2020. Moving the StudyGroup online seemed like a good solution, but participation dwindled towards summer (3 meetings were held), likely as a result of over exposure to online meetings, conferences, and workshops etc. The StudyGroup was thus put on halt during the fall.

### Recruiting

4 new instructors (with a focus on R) could be recruited for UiO-Carpentry, another instructor is in training. Two seats came out of the NeiC CodeRefinery Platinum Membership (UiO members were eligible due to UiO's membership in NeiC). In addition, an already certified instructor recently joint UiO. Several new helpers could be recruited and supported workshops both on-site and online during 2020.

During the membership period of August 2020 to August 2021, UiO received 5 instructor training spots via its Silver Membership. One seat from the 2020/21 lot was used during the previous period 2019/20.

Actively recruiting candidates from the UiO-Carpentry community for these spots had to be postponed to 2021. Several potential instructors declined the offer due to lack of time. A more active recruitment has to be initiated in early 2021.

### Social Events

Two social events for the UiO-Carpentry community were arranged online, one at the end of summer and one before Christmas 2020. They were held online.
* 2020-09-17: UiO-Carpentry "fika"-time
* 2020-12-17: UiO-Carpentry Christmas mingle

In addition, two online meetings for the Nordic-Baltic Carpentries region were held online, hosted by the UiO-Carpentry local coordinator (AR) and the regional coordinator for the Nordic and Baltic countries (NT).
* 2020-08-07: Social Meetup during CarpentryCon@Home
* 2020-10-30: Community Discussion for Nordic-Baltic Carpentries

## Organisation

### Local Community Coordinator

The tasks of the local community coordinator were shared by AR and NT (both University of Oslo library). In practice, this means support in recruiting instructors and helpers for workshops, setting up workshop websites, setting up and managing workshop registration, communication with workshop participants, communication with The Carpentries regarding workshops, maintenance of the UiO-Carpentry websites hosted by UiO/UBO as well as the community website hosted on GitHub, managing mailing lists, communication with the UiO-community via mailing lists, booking rooms and/or setting up virtual rooms, checking in with instructors and helpers before and after workshops.

The local coordinators established and documented effective routines for most tasks regarding hosting workshops and community-communication.

### Board

In March 2020, the UiO-Carpentry Board was successfully constituted. The election took place in February and 4 Board Members were elected for a term of 2 years. In addition, the UiO library appointed two Board Members. The Board consists of the following members:

* **Chair** Lex Nederbragt
* **Vice chair** Viviane Girardin
* **Communication officer** Naoe Tatara (appointed by UiO library)
* **Secretary** Tobias Busch
* Annika Rockenberger (appointed by UiO library)
* Anne Bergsaker

The Board can be contacted via board@carpentry.uio.no. The Board had 4 meetings during 2020, minutes for the meetings can be found in (/meetings), "yyddmm_board-meeting.md".

### Website

The new website (https://www.ub.uio.no/english/writing-publishing/dsc/carpentry-uio/index.html)…

### GitHub, Communication

All official documentation of workshops and other activities of UiO-Carpentry is published under the [UiO-Carpentry GitHub organisation](https://github.com/uio-carpentry). The GitHub repositories are actively maintained by the community, the Board, and the local coordinators.
Apart from repositories for workshop websites, UiO-Carpentry maintains the following community repositories:

* [governance](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/governance) (community statutes, code of conduct, procedures)
* [organisational](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational) (reports, onboarding documents, how-tos)
* [studygroup](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/studyGroup) (StudyGroup website and events)
* [uio-carpentry.github.io](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/uio-carpentry.github.io) (workshop backlog and calendar)

A major change was made to communications: the domain for the UiO-Carpentry mailing lists was changed from @swcarpentry to @carpentry. In addition, two underused mailing lists were discarded (resbaz and …). The community now actively uses the following mailing lists:

* carpadmin @ carpentry dot uio dot no --> coordinators at the University Library and the chair person of the Carpentry@UiO Board
* organizers @ carpentry dot uio dot no --> all instructors and helpers, plus those on the carpadmin list
* announcements @ carpentry dot uio dot no --> all people that have shown interest or have attended workshops + those on the organizers list
* contact-us @ carpentry dot uio dot no--> coordinators at the University Library. To be used for workshop communications
* board @ carpentry dot uio dot no--> the members of the Carpentry@UiO Board

All lists have been updated.

The subscribers of the organizers list have been contacted and asked for re-subscription. There are now 41 active members on the list of previously <80 of unclear status.
Via the list, instructors and helpers for workshops are recruited and information relevant to the UiO-Carpentry community is communicated.
