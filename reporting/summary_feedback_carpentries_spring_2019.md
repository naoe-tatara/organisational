 _Don't forget to update the workshop and course registry on our website [https://uio-carpentry.github.io/](https://uio-carpentry.github.io/) - everyone can edit the file `index.md` in our GitHub repository [https://github.com/uio-carpentry/uio-carpentry.github.io](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/uio-carpentry.github.io)_

### Utilization

We had booked rooms for 19 full-day workshops, we held 9 workshops.

## Feedback From Our Learners

We got feedback for 6 workshops.

### Who Are Our Learners?

The Majority of our learners are Phds - and researchers on various levels.
We have a few students, mainly on masters' level, and a couple of engineers with various backgrounds.

![Who are our learners - academic background](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/reporting/images/carpentry_report_2019_01_chart_role_learner.png)

*There seems to be confusion about what to choose as "role"; perhaps we could add an explanation to the Nettskjema or add more fields to choose from?*

### Which Institutions Are Our Learners Affiliated With?

The vast majority is from UiO. A few learners are from other universities: OsloMet (1) and NMBU (5).
Some are from the University Hospital (3), the Veterinarian Institute (1), The Institute of Cancer Research (1) NIVA (3), Noroff (1) and TÃ˜I (1).
The individual departments are rarely mentioned.

*A third of those filling out the Nettskjema did not write their institutional affiliation: Why? -- There seems to be confusion around what we are asking for here, and perhaps: Why we want to know their affiliation in the first place.*

### What Workshop or Topics Are Our Learners Missing?

* Summing up from the surveys, most learners are interested in learning any or more of **Python** and **R**. Most want to use it for data analysis, thus requesting focus on packages like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **SciPy** etc.
* They also want more targeted courses on specific kinds of data (e.g. **ecology**, **climate**, **bio**, **archeology**, **spatio-temporal**).
* Generally, learners ask to learn more about **statistics** or want to do more practical statistical analysis with R or Python.
* Additionally, **plotting** and **visualization** are requested.

* Indepented from language, many learners asked for workshops dealing with **data preparation** and **data cleaning** - basically everything that happens before analysis.

* **Machine learning** is more and more requested.

* Generally, there is a need for **more workshops on advanced levels**. Learners who aren't novices anymore don't seem to find workshops for their level; this might also be a reason for why our workshops often have quite advanced learners even though they are explicitely targeted towards novices -- an issue that occasionally leads to overbooked workshops and dissatisfied learners and teachers.

* There is also the request for workshops for **specific tools**, like **SPSS**. USIT has courses; we could consider spreading information about these at our workshops.

* Summing up: Including more **Data Carpentry** workshops could help meet the learners's needs.

### Comments and Constructive Criticism

* Generally, our learners really appreciate that we offer workshops on a variety of topics and rate the workshops overall very positively. Our instructors are highly regarded for their enthusiasm, teaching spirit and patience and the helper-system gets univocally positive feedback.

**Positives are: Helpers and individual assistance -- enthusiastic teachers -- pedagogic teaching -- good atmosphere -- real life examples (data, code)**

* There is a certain amount of criticism, not all of which is directed at our workshop organisation and instructores.
* Generally, **communication before the workshop** could be improved. **Prior to the workshops, **clearer instructions on installation
of software**, **download of data sets or code bits** and ** quick self-tests** are recommended.
* Apart from that, learners would like to get a more **realistic schedule for the the workshop**: will the topics mentioned in the schedule actually be taught in the workshop. *(Comment AR: We have experienced that we
are note able to teach the entire Python module in one day; of 10 lessons we manage 6; the course description has the entire 10 lessons, thus creating expectations we cannot meet).*
* **Time management** and **workshop logistics** have been mentioned as an area of improvement, especially when it comes to **breaks**.
* Overall, our instructors and helpers receive very positive feedback. However, **live coding and navigation speed** is sometimes an issue as are too short or missing explanations.
* Most criticism is directed at co-learners who arrive unprepared which leads to delays and occupies helpers and instructors

### Are We Reaching Our Goals With Software Carpentry?

YES. We reach them fully -- or at least somewhat.

![Are We Reaching Our Goals?](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/reporting/images/carpentry_report_2019_01_chart_goals.png)

### Should We Have Other And More Workshops at UiO?

Overwhelmingly YES.

### Would You Recommend This Workshop To A Friend Or Colleague?

![Would You Recommend Us?](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/reporting/images/carpentry_report_2019_01_chart_recommendation.png)

Overwhelmingly, learners strongly agree or agree that they would recommend our workshops.
Only a tiny number is either neutral, or disagrees.

### Have You, After The Course, Used What You Learned?

![Have You Used What You Have Learned?](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/reporting/images/carpentry_report_2019_01_chart_usefulness.png)

Half answered that they haven't yet used what they've learned but might in the future, while roughly a third answered that they have used some of it. A little less than a quarter of learners said they've used most or all of it. Only one person had not used anything at all.

### Was This Workshop Worth My Time?

![Was It Worth Your Time?](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/reporting/images/carpentry_report_2019_01_chart_worth_time.png)

Overwhelmingly, learners answered that they strongly agreed or agreed that the workshop was worth their time. A few were neutral as to whether it was worth their time, while 3 disagreed or strongly disagreed.

### How Much Practical Knowledge Did You Gain From The Workshop?

![Practical Knowledge?](https://github.com/uio-carpentry/organisational/blob/master/reporting/images/carpentry_report_2019_01_chart_practical_knowledge.png)

Much more than half of the learners answered that they learned a great deal, while roughly a third answered that they gained some practical knowledge. One answered that they gained none.
