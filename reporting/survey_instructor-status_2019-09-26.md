# Survey – Carpentry@UiO Instructor Status Quo

## Introduction and Purpose

Dear fellow Carpenter!

The Carpentry@UiO community is alive and well – a new team of coordinators from the University Library together with the Interim Board are working hard to support you in teaching workshops in the Carpentries spirit.

In order to gain a better and more up-to-date overview of who we are as a community, the Interim Board and the University Library have created a short survey about the status quo of our instructors.

If you are a certified The Carpentries instructor (Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry) and you are located in the Oslo area, we kindly ask you to take 5 minutes to answer our survey.

Your contribution will make sure that the Carpentry@UiO community thrives!

### Confidentiality 

Your responses will be collected in Nettskjema and exported as an .xlsx file to be then shared on UiO's G-Suite platform with the members of the Interim and later Elected Board and the Carpentry@UiO coordinators at the University of Oslo Library. We will keep your responses for no longer than five years after which they will be deleted. We do not intend to publish any of the responses.

### Risks and Benefits

There are no direct risks or benefits to you from filling out this survey and no compensation. We hope to use these results to improve how we run the community and Carpentries workshops.

### Consent

You are not required to take this survey. You may quit the survey at any time or skip any item other than those required to correctly sort your responses.
