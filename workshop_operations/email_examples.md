## {EVENTNAME} - Pre-workshop check-in
Dear {FIRSTNAME}

The “{EVENTNAME}” course is **[here you write an appropriate thing, like tomorrow, next monday, etc.]**.
As we have more sign-ups than the capacity allows, we will run the course as planned :)

### In case you cannot come…
If it became impossible to attend, please de-register from the link below **[NB! Check the "Include link to event" below the message field]** as soon as possible so that those who are in the waiting list can get a seat. 

**[For Git workshop]** Please note that it is important that you are ready at the seminar room (209, Niels Henrik Abels hus) on time, as the first part of the course is very important for the rest of the day. Also, if you got sick on the day, please send a line to contact-us@carpentry.uio.no.

If you get sick, please send an email to contact-us@carpentry.uio.no by **7:00 of the workshop day** so that we can deregister you.

### Make sure you have done setting up
Please follow the setup instructions for " **[anything appropriate here]** " on  **[workshop URL]**. 

### Please complete the pre-workshop survey
Please be sure to complete Pre-workshop Survey **[survey URL]** before the workshop.
