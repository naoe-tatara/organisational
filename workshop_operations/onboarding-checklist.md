# Onboarding Checklist

## How do I get started with teaching a Carpentries workshop at UiO?

### **I want to teach a workshop!**
- [ ] Several times per semester, a call for co-instructors will be sent out to organizers @ carpentry dot uio dot no mailing list. Reply to the call if you are interested!
- [ ] You can also contact the local or the regional coordinator and propose a workshop by sending an email to carpadmin @ carpentry dot uio dot no
- We try to have at least one certified The Carpentries co-instructor. Not yet certified? Contact us by email to carpadmin @ carpentry dot uio dot no
---

### **What lessons can I teach?**
- You can teach any of the core lessons from [Software](http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), [Data](http://datacarpentry.org/lessons/), or [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/)!
- You can also teach any of the additional lessons from the Carpentries curriculum.
- You have developed lesson material and want to teach your own workshops? Ask us by email to digitalscholarship at ub dot uio dot no

### **I am looking for co-instructors and helpers!**
- [ ] Ask the community by sending an email to organizers @ carpentry dot uio dot no
- [ ] Tip: ask for new helpers via announcements @ carpentry dot uio dot no
---

### **I want to create a workshop website. How do I go about it?**
- [ ] Create a GitHub profile for yourself
- [ ] Ask carpadmin @ carpentry dot uio dot no to invite you as a member of uio-carpentry https://github.com/uio-carpentry
- [ ] Open https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template and click the ```Use this template``` button in green
- [ ] Check that the website is created properly, i.e. that "uio-carpentry" as chosen as owner, the name of the repository is `YYYY-MM-DD-site`, and that "Public" is chosen
- <b> Note</b>: Although a repository is created under uio-carpentry GitHub account, the slug naming convention should be followed and ` uio` needs to be used for `site`. For example, if the first date of the workshop is 25th August 2020 and to be held in any campus of UiO, it should be `2020-08-25-uio`.
- [ ] Write the lesson type in the description
- [ ] Edit the necessary parts by following README.md "Customizing Your Website"
- [ ] The website will be automatically created
- [ ] Send the link to the website to carpadmin @ carpentry dot uio dot no – the coordinators will create an event on the University Library's course catalogue and create a registration form
- [ ] Submit your workshop to the Carpentries database by following the instructions on this website https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/ – the Regional Coordinator will check if everything is correct.
---

### **How do I get in contact with workshop participants?**
- [ ] If you want to get in contact with participants, please send an email to carpadmin @ carpentry dot uio dot no so that the local coordinator will send the email on behalf of you from the registration system
- *Registration for workshops is handled by the local coordinator. By default, registration is closed two weeks prior to the workshop date. Automatic reminders for workshop participants are sent out via the registration system one week and again three days before the workshop. Any additional information that were sent to workshop participants from instructors can be set in the registration system so that is is automatically sent when one in the waiting list is offered a seat due to cancellation of someone else.*
- Workshop participants can ask for a Certificate of Attendance after the workshop:
- [ ] For non-standard workshops (e.g. when only a part of core lessons are covered), a certificate is generated automatically – ask your local coordinator about it
- [ ] For standard workshops (i.e., 2-day full program covering all [core lessons](https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-core)), learner certificates can be obtained by following the instructions in the [Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/certificates.html)

### **Which room(s) will I be teaching in?**
<!-- Update this list for each new onboarding session -->
In Autumn semester 2020, only a lecture room 209 in Niels Henrik Abels hus is to be used. 
Due to very limited capacity and availability of any lecture/seminar rooms in general, we cannot use any other room.
Please make sure that you and the learners wipe facilities and areas they used with surface disinfectant wipes available right outside of the room.
<!-- 
- [ ] Seminar room 123 in Vilhelm Bjerknes' hus (the Science Library, ground floor)
- [ ] Teaching room 209 in the Science Library - Science Fiction Section
- [ ] Want a different room? You can ask the local coordinator to book a room for you
-->
<!-- - [ ] Abels Utsikt on the top floor of the Mathematics Building - Niels Henrik Abels hus
- [ ] Seminar room 3508 in the Biosciences Building - Kristine Bonnevies hus
- [ ] Group room 4436 in the Biosciences Building - Kristine Bonnevies hus -->

### **Where do I find the Carpentries equipment (cables, extension cords, sticky notes)?**
<!-- Check if any change is needed before each onboarding session -->
- [ ] It is found in a white cupboard in the lecture room 209, Niels Henrik Abels hus. 
---

### **What do I have to do before, during, and after a workshop?**

- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the [Carpentries Guidelines for running workshops](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html#instructor-checklist)
- [ ] Read carefully the [latest version of infection prevention guideline at UiO](https://www.uio.no/english/about/hse/corona/guidelines/infection-prevention-guide.html)
 
 **Important: If you cannot come to UiO according to the guideline [2.1.7 When should students and staff not come to UiO?](https://www.uio.no/english/about/hse/corona/guidelines/infection-prevention-guide.html#2-1-7), please let co-instructor(s), helper(s), and carpadmin @ carpentry dot uio dot no, as soon as possible**
 
 Additionally, we ask you kindly to
- *Co-instructor*
  - [ ] Coordinate with your co-instructors and helpers
  - [ ] Coordinate with the local or regional coordinator
  - [ ] Make sure the equipment you are planning to use works in the seminar room
  - [ ] Explain the Code of Conduct in the beginning of the workshop
  - [ ] Do a short security briefing in the beginning of the workshop
  - [ ] Take attendance using the [workshops attendance list](/workshops_attendance_list.pdf) provided in the equipment box
  - [ ] Ask the participants to answer post-workshop survey linked from the workshop website at the end of the workshop
  - [ ] Leave the seminar room clean and orderly; make sure that no equipment is left, windows are closed and lights are off

- *Helpers*
  - [ ] Get in contact with the co-instructors, familiarize yourself with the teaching materials and exercises. It is usually in the very beginning and during exercises that helpers are needed most
  - [ ] (For 2 full-day standard workshop) Make sure that the coffee station looks tidy
  - [ ] Be attentive: look actively for sticky notes coming up – and if participants look lost during lessons
  - [ ] If you see that a lot of sticky notes come up or many participants get lost, gently interrupt the co-instructor, so that everyone can catch up
---

### **How is the workshop de-briefing done?**
- [ ] Collect the sticky-note feedback after the workshop
- [ ] Right after the workshop, do a brief feedback round with your co-instructors and helpers
- [ ] A few days after the workshop, one of the co-instructors writes up a short summary of the feedback and general impressions from the workshop and sends these to the co-instructors and helpers
- [ ] One week after the workshop, the local coordinator will send out a workshop evalulation form to all participants. A summary of all feedback is provided after each term in the form of a presentation or a written report by the coordinator. Ask the local coordinator for the feedback for your workshop at any time.
