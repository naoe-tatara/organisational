# General

* It is mandatory to use the `Bcc` field for sending emails to participants - that way we protect participants' privacy by not displaying email addresses to all recipients.

  * ``carpadmin @ carpentry dot uio dot no`` --> coordinators at the University Library and the chair person of the Carpentry@UiO Board
  * ``organizers @ carpentry dot uio dot no`` --> all instructors and helpers, plus those on the carpadmin list
  * ``announcements @ carpentry dot uio dot no`` --> all people that have shown interest or have attended workshops + those on the organizers list

# Lead instructor

## Initial Preparation

* the coordinators will send out calls for workshops regularly during the academic year to ``organizers @ carpentry dot uio dot no``
* you can always also propose to teach a workshop by sending an email to ``carpadmin @ carpentry dot uio dot no``
* To generate the workshop website at uio-carpentry.github.com:
  1) make sure you are a member of uio-carpentry, the [uio-carpentry github organisation](https://github.com/orgs/uio-carpentry/people). If you aren't, send an email to ``carpadmin @ carpentry.uio.no`` with your GitHub username to invite you.
  2) create the webpage using the template from https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template. 
    - NOTE: 
    - use the followings for the repository name (and not python/R/oslo... or any other text): 
     - For in-person workshop: *YYYY-MM-DD-uio* 
     - For online workshop: *YYYY-MM-DD-uio-online* 
     - When the workshop is to be run over several days, set *the start date* of the workshop for YYYY-MM-DD part. 
    - and *choose the organisation uio-carpentry as owner* for the workshop repository when you import the template. (If needed, ownership can be transferred later)
  3) plan time schedule well with breaks and exercise time, as trouble shootings may easily eat up time, and 
  4) plan *the last 5 minutes* for closing remarks with the time to write feedback and the Carpentries post-workshop survey (link on the workshop website). 
* Submit a self-organized workshop to Carpentry central from [this form](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/).     Note: If you're running a one-day workshop, choose *Short session (less than two days)*, and UiO workshops are usually public, so please choose *This event is open to the public*. You may add your co-instructors'/helpers' email addresses in the last field where you are asked about communication.
  The Regional Coordinator will then register instructor information at the Carpentry's sytem as well as make workshop information visible on Carpentry website. 
* organise pre-workshop meeting with the other instructors and the helpers to go through lesson materials etc.

## A Week Before

* ask local coordinator to send the link to the pre-workshop questionnaire to attendants

## The Day Before

* if you can, set up the room (tables, chairs), try out the projector, check the network, etc.
* check whether you have or need an adapter to connect your laptop to the monitor in the workshop room

## At/during the workshop

* send the workshop attendance list around or check of attendance yourself. Hand the list to one of the local coordinators
* collect feedback from sticky notes
* if there is time at the end of the workshop make attendants aware of the post-workshop questionnaire to increase response rate
* collect workshop equipment after the workshop
* set the room
* if catering was provided for the workshop, leave the crate with coffee thermos and other dishes outside the room

## After the workshop

* send post-workshop questionnaire to attendants (even though you may have sent it already at the workshop, to reach those that had to leave early)
* for standard Carpentries workshops, send an email to the Carpentries admin at ``team @ carpentries dot org`` with the number of attendants for both days
* obtain the post-workshop assessment form link from the workshop's uio-carpentry.github.io pages, or from SWC/DC admin
* download the workshop etherpad in text format; take out any information that should not be sent around and send it to the participants
* organise a post-workshop debriefing with the other instructors and the helper
* optionally, deliver sticky note feedback to the local coordinator's office for archiving

# Helpers

## At/during the workshop

* if there is catering for the workshop: if coffee, tea, or water runs out contact local coordinator or the library contact and see if more can be arranged
* help collecting workshop equipment after the workshop
* help setting the room
* be attentive: you likely notice participants' challenges and problems much better than the instructors
* be kind to yourselves: no one expects you to know solutions to all the problems

# University Library

## Initial Preparation

* book rooms for the semester

* set up a registration form (Pindena)

     * sticky notes
     * non-permanent markers and/or chalk
     * pens

## After the workshop

* collect essentials from the workshop room and make sure the room looks OK for the next user
   * check whether tables need a quick wipe, especially the table having the coffee cans on
   * empty tables
